I am a passionate Web Developer specializing in React.js with over 1 year of experience in Front-End Development and expertise in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). My journey in web development is fueled by a strong commitment to crafting efficient, responsive, and user-friendly applications.

While my primary focus has been on front-end development, building visually appealing and highly interactive user interfaces, I am equally excited about diving deeper into back-end development. The prospect of designing robust APIs, optimizing server-side logic, and ensuring seamless communication between the front and back ends truly excites me.
